## About me
<hr>
I am an oceanographer, marine geochemist, and fifth year Ph.D. student in chemical oceanography at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](http://www.whoi.edu) (WHOI) and the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu) (MIT). My research has taken me to Antarctica (twice; check out my blog, [here](http://web.whoi.edu/coldsuncommuncation)) and throughout the world's oceans on various research vessels.

My [research](/research/) explores the various biological and abiotic processes that degrade and remineralize organic matter in the surface ocean. I am interested in both anthropogenic and natural sources of stress to the microorganisms (algae and bacteria) that are the foundation of marine ecosystems.  

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. studies in the [MIT/WHOI Joint Program](http://mit.whoi.edu/), I earned a master's degree in environmental science from the [Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies](http://environment.yale.edu). In my research there, I worked with [Dr. Peter Raymond](https://environment.yale.edu/profile/raymond/).

Before matriculating at Yale for my master's degree, I served on active duty for five years in the [United States Coast Guard](http://www.uscg.mil). After graduating with a commission from Officer Candidate School in 2004, I served ashore in Jacksonville, Florida, and in a variety of capacities at sea. I served as deck watch officer, boarding officer, and First Lieutenant aboard [USCGC FORWARD](http://www.uscg.mil/lantarea/cgcForward/) in Portsmouth, Virginia, and as Executive Officer of [USCGC PENOBSCOT BAY](http://www.uscg.mil/D1/cgcPenobscotBay/default.asp), a 140-foot icebreaker tug homeported in Bayonne, New Jersey. I currently serve as a lieutenant commander (O-4) in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve.

In summer 2010, I was deployed for two months to Mobile, Alabama, as part of the Coast Guard's response to the Deepwater Horizon drilling disaster. During the disaster, I served as director of an interagency team whose mission was to find and identify residual oil that had accumulated beneath the ocean's surface in the coastal waters of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.

In a brief previous life, I worked as a newspaper journalist at the [Boston Globe](http://www.bostonglobe.com/), [Albany Times Union](http://www.timesunion.com), and [St. Louis Post-Dispatch](http://www.stltoday.com/). I graduated from [Yale College](http://www.yale.edu) in 2004 with a master's degree in political science. At Yale, I was Managing Editor of the [Yale Daily News](http://www.yaledailynews.com).

I hold a 100-ton commercial Coast Guard master's license (near coastal waters, with towing endorsement) and I am a certified Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) counselor.

When not engaged in some aspect of science, I enjoy boating and fishing on and around Cape Cod, skiing (both nordic and downhill), running, cycling, camping, gardening, and woodworking. When indoors, I also enjoy coding and (occasionally) web design.
