## Miscellany
<hr>
A loosely-organized jumble of things I like, things in which I am interested, things in which I feel others might be interested, things I've found on the Internet, and slides for talks I've given.
&nbsp;  

### Slides from talks
<hr>
&raquo; [Some modest advice about open-source software development](/assets/slides/20170127_Some-thoughts-on-OS-software-dev't-WHOI-J.- Collins.key.pdf): Slides prepared for a January 27, 2017, workshop organized by WHOI's [Ocean Informatics initiative](http://www.whoi.edu/DoR/special-projects/ocean-informatics-working-group). Includes some advice on development of R packages for submission to [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/), based on lessons learned from development of the [LOBSTAHS](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS/) package. Final few slides contain links to some Internet resources that cover package documentation and best practices for open-source software development.
