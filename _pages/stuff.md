## Miscellany
<hr>
&raquo; [Communicating Under a Cold Sun](http://web.whoi.edu/coldsuncommunication): Blog I maintained during my two seasons at [Palmer Station](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/plr/support/palmerst.jsp) in Antarctica.

&raquo; Fishing reports for Cape Cod and environs: [On the Water](http://www.onthewater.com/regions/cape-cod-buzzards-bay/) | [Salty Cape](http://saltycape.com/)
