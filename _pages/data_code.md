## Data & code
<hr>
As a scientist, I believe in **open access** &mdash; that is, making *code*, *software*, and *data* freely available for others. In the case of my [published research](/publications/), I have endeavored to provide all data and code necessary to replicate the data analysis and figures/tables on which I based my scientific conclusions. I am guided and inspired in my scientific endeavors by the open access, documentation, and provenance requirements of the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov)'s [EarthCube](http://earthcube.org) project and the [Geoscience Papers of the Future](http://www.ontosoft.org/gpf/what-is-a-gpf) initiative.

I've also attempted to make available many other scripts and code (mostly in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and (sorry) [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/index.html)) to accomplish other scientific and non-scientific computing tasks. Most of these can be found in [various repositories I maintain on GitHub](https://github.com/jamesrco). Because I am an [oceanographer and biogeochemist](/research/), most of these pertain to the geosciences. Among these is [a set of scripts for processing and analyzing bacterial production data](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd) obtained using the <sup>3</sup>H-leucine incorporation method. (Some of the original BP code is [Krista Longnecker](http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=90833)'s.)

### Data and code for published projects
<hr>
Links to data and code for published projects can be downloaded using the links on my [Publications](/publications/) page. Once there, expand each entry using the <i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> icon.

### Other software and code
<hr>
Visit me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesrco). Also the [main contributor here](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics).

### Some links for those interested in data, data science, and data visualization 
<hr>
&raquo; The [Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO)](http://www.bco-dmo.org/). Also, [some pointers](http://www.bco-dmo.org/submitting-data-spreadsheet) for cocercing dates, times, geographical positions, and other data into an acceptable format for upload to BCO-DMO. 
<br>&raquo; [Geoscience Papers of the Future Initiative](http://www.ontosoft.org/gpf/). If you can, attend a [training session](http://www.ontosoft.org/gpf/training-sessions).
<br>&raquo; The [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) project.
