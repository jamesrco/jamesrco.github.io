## Academic research interests
<hr>
In my academic research, I am interested in the connections between climate change and national security, the science and policy of marine oil spill response, and the various biological and abiotic processes that degrade organic matter in marine and aquatic ecosystems. To this end, I use computational and experimental techniques to query biological processes such as aerobic respiration, mechanical processes such as dissolution and disaggregation of sinking particles, and abiotic processes such as photo-oxidation. I am interested in these degradation processes because they are often direct manifestations of the many sources of stress, both anthropogenic and natural, that microorganisms encounter in marine and aquatic ecosystems. We can use the information we gain through study of these processes to tell us about the health of these ecosystems, and to inform the policies we might implement to preserve them.

In my thesis research, I [developed and applied new, open-source, 'omics-based data discovery methods](/cv/#professional-publications) to analyze and identify lipid biomarkers for various stressors and degradation pathways in both cultures and samples from the marine environment. The free, open-source [LOBSTAHS software](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS) is the centerpiece of a lipidomics approach that mines large volumes of high-resolution mass spectrometer data for molecules that serve as "chemical signatures" of these processes. As part of a team at WHOI, I assisted in the development of a new instrument, the [PHORCYS](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=80539&tid=282&cid=174909), which makes <i>in situ</i> measurements of respiration and photosynthesis in the marine and aquatic ecosystems. Data from the PHORCYS can tell us about the trophic state of these systems how nutrients and carbon are cycled within them. We described the PHORCYS [in a 2018 paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10247) in <i>Limnology & Oceanography: Methods</i>. 

I integrate novel computational approaches to data discovery into nearly all my projects. I am viscerally committed to making my [data, code](/data_code/), and research processes (i.e., provenance) [available and open](/data_code/) to all.
