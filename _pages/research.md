## Research interests and current projects
<hr>
My research explores the various biological and abiotic processes that contribute to the oxidation of organic matter in the surface ocean. I use computational and experimental techniques to query biological processes such as aerobic respiration, mechanical processes such as dissolution and disaggregation of sinking particles, and abiotic processes such as photo-oxidation. I am interested in these processes because they are often direct manifestations of the many sources of stress &mdash; both anthropogenic and natural &mdash; that microorganisms encounter in marine ecosystems. My interest in the degradation and remineralization of organic matter extends to both the particulate and dissolved phases.

In my thesis research, I [developed and applied new, open-source, 'omics-based data discovery methods](/cv/#professional-publications) to analyze and identify lipid biomarkers for various stressors and degradation pathways in both cultures and samples from the marine environment. The free, open-source [LOBSTAHS software](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS) is the centerpiece of a lipidomics approach that mines large volumes of high-resolution mass spectrometer data for molecules that serve as "chemical signatures" of these processes. As part of a team at WHOI, I assisted in the development of a new instrument, the [PHORCYS](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=80539&tid=282&cid=174909), which makes <i>in situ</i> measurements of respiration and photosynthesis in the surface ocean.

I integrate novel computational approaches to data discovery into nearly all my projects. I viscerally committed to making my [data, code](/data_code/), and research processes (i.e., provenance) [available and open](/data_code/) to all.
