 <h2>Welcome</h2>
 <hr> 
<p>I am currently a State On-Scene Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DEQ/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a>. In my role as SOSC, I supervise the state's response to spills and releases of oil and other hazardous materials in 18 counties east of the Oregon Cascades.</p>
<p>My areas of expertise include the science and policy of oil spill response operations, the national security implications of climate change and natural disasters, and the integration of civilian disaster response operations with U.S. military capabilities. I have more than a decade of on-the-ground experience responding to oil spills and natural disasters throughout the Western Hemisphere at the state, federal, and international levels. My practical experience is complemented by a decade of formal scientific training as a marine geochemist, seagoing oceanographer and environmental data scientist.</p>
<p>I hold a Ph.D. in chemical oceanography from the <a href="http://mit.whoi.edu/">MIT/WHOI Joint Program</a> and a master's degree in environmental science from the <a href="http://environment.yale.edu">Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies</a>. I served for five years on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard and I am currently an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve, where I hold several Incident Command System certifications.</p>
