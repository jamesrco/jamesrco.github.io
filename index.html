 <h2>Welcome</h2>
 <hr> 
<p>I currently a State On-Scene Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DEQ/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a>. In my role as SOSC, I supervise the initial response to spills/releases of oil and other hazardous materials in 18 counties east of the Cascades. My areas of expertise include the science and policy of oil spill response operations, the national security implications of climate change and natural disasters, and the integration of civilian disaster response operations with U.S. military capabilities. I hold a Ph.D. in chemical oceanography from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program and a master's degree in environmental science from the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies. I am trained as a marine geochemist, oceanographer and data scientist and I have extensive experience in responding to oil spills and natural disasters throughout the Western Hemisphere. I served on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard from 2004-2009 and I am currently an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve, where I hold several Incident Command System certifications.</p>
