<h2>Welcome to my (new) website</h2>
<p>I am an oceanographer, marine geochemist, and fifth year Ph.D. student in chemical oceanography at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Please use the links on the navigation bar above to explore the various pages; I'll be adding more content soon.</p>
