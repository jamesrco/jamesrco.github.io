<h2>Welcome</h2>
<hr>
<p>I am a marine geochemist, oceanographer, and (as of January 2017) recent recipient of a Ph.D. in chemical oceanography from the <a href="http://www.whoi.edu">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a> (WHOI) and <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT). In April, I will be moving west to begin a Moore/Sloan and Washington Research Foundation Innovation Postdoctoral Fellowship in Data Science at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>'s <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">eScience Institute</a>.
